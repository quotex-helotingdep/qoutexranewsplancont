trade over 200 assets across various financial instruments, including

## Is Quotex a Scam?

Yes, we believe that Quotex is a scam and you should not open an account
with them.

Their trading platform, trading tools and service agreement are designed
to make traders lose money in the long run. Quotex is not regulated by
any financial authorities so it is not a safe and legit broker and
nobody is protecting traders\' interest against shady, unfair business
practices.

## Why We Think Quotex is Not a Safe Broker

### 1. Not regulated at all

Quotex is based in St. Kitts and Nevis where there is no regulatory
framework for online trading brokers. This means that Quotex is not
licenced and overseen by any financial authorities and does not offer
any form of investor protection, such as compensation funds, negative
balance protections, and client fund segregation.

### 2. It\'s easy to lose money while trading at Quotex

Quotex exclusively offers binary options trading (fixed time trading as
they call it), a high-risk high-reward trading type that makes trading
very exciting, but also very risky. It\'s very hard to be profitable at
binary options trading, even for experienced traders, because assets
price movements are almost unpredictable in such short timeframes.

### 3. Misleading marketing tactics and trading tools

Quotex uses misleading marketing tactics and questionable trading
practices that make potential traders believe that they can make easy
and guaranteed money on their platform.

-   Trading signals with 87% accuracy
-   Shady Deposit Bonus Terms
-   Quotex "guaranteed winning" strategies

### 4. Bad reputation, many negative user reviews

Quotex receives many negative reviews about the difficulty in money
withdrawals, blocked trading accounts for made-up reasons and bad
customer service from its users complaining on Reddit, Trustpilot, and
other credible review platforms.

## Is Quotex Legal?

\*\*Quotex\*\* \*\*is not legal in most countries like the USA, India,
Pakistan, Singapore, Philippines or the European Economic Area,\*\*
because the broker is not registered with the local regulatory
organizations.

Quotex is technically not illegal and not explicitly banned in South
Africa, but it\'s not regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct
Authority (FSCA), \*\*so your capital is not protected, if you are a
South African trader.\*\*
